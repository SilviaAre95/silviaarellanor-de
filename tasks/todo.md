## Review Summary

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Projects Navigation**
   - Added `id="projects"` to the Projects section in `src/pages/Projects/Projects.jsx`
   - This fixed the navigation issue where clicking Projects in the header wasn't scrolling to the section

2. **Added Blog Section**
   - Created new component: `src/pages/Blog/Blog.jsx`
   - Displays 4 featured Medium articles with title, excerpt, date, and read time
   - Added "View All Articles on Medium" button at the bottom
   - Integrated into the main page scroll flow

3. **Added Products Page**
   - Created new component: `src/pages/Products/Products.jsx`
   - Separate page (not a scroll section) for digital products
   - Shows 4 data engineering products with descriptions, features, and prices
   - Each product has a "Buy on Gumroad" button
   - Includes a "Back to Portfolio" link

4. **Updated Navigation**
   - Modified `src/pages/Header/Header.jsx` to include Blog in scroll navigation
   - Added Products as a separate route that opens in the same tab
   - Products link uses React Router navigation while other links use smooth scroll

5. **App Structure Updates**
   - Restructured `src/App.jsx` to use React Router for both home and products pages
   - Home page contains all scroll sections (Hero, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, Blog, Contact)
   - Products page is a separate route at `/products`
   - Header and Footer are hidden on the Products page for a cleaner look

### Important Notes:
- Remember to update the Medium username in the Blog component's article links and "View All" button
- Update the Gumroad links in the Products component with your actual product URLs
- The sample data in both Blog and Products components should be replaced with your actual content
